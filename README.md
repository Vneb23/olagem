## Project description

This program is heavily inspired by the website 10FastFingers, wich provides an easy typing speed test. However, you just type random words. So the goal is to make a sentence generator in order to improve this.

## State of the project

The first version of the typing part is good. Now we just need a good generator.

## Dependencies

This project currently needs lua to run (made in lua 5.3 but supposedly works in 5.1).
