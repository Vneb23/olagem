## Project description

This program is heavily inspired by the website 10FastFingers, wich provides an easy typing speed test. However, you just type random words. So the goal is to make a sentence generator in order to improve this.

## Installation

Wherever you want, clone this git repo using the command
```
git clone https://github.com/Vneb23/olagem.git
```

If you don't have lua installed, you would need to install it. Go to lua.org for more information.

Then, just run the  command
```
sudo make install
```
and you'r done !

To start the program, type
```
./olagem
```
in your terminal.

You can get help by typing
```
man olagem
```
in your terminal.

## State of the project

The first version of the typing part is good. Now we just need a good generator.

## Dependencies

This project currently needs lua to run (made in lua 5.3 but supposedly works in 5.1).
