## Project description

This program is heavily inspired by the website 10FastFingers, wich provides an easy typing speed test. However, you just type random words. So the goal is to make a sentence generator in order to improve this.

## State of the project

Far from finished. I'm just about finishing the "game" part. The sentence generator is far from done.


## Dependencies

This project currently needs lua to run (made in lua 5.3 but supposedly works in 5.1).
